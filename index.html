          <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
          <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to
            structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be
            structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or
            using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article
            will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="So_what_is_HTML?">
          <h2>So what is HTML?</h2>
          <p>
            HTML is a <em>markup language</em> that defines the structure of
            your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use
            to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it
            appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can
            make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize
            words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example,
            take the following line of content:
          </p>
          <code>My cat is very grumpy</code>
          <p>
            If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it
            is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
          </p>
          <code
            ><span class="code-element">&lt;p&gt;</span>My cat is very
            grump<span class="code-element">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
          </code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_Element">
          <h2>Anatomy of an HTML Element</h2>
          <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
          <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>The opening tag</strong>: This consists of the name of the
              element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing
              <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element
              begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph
              begins.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The closing tag</strong>: This is the same as the opening
              tag, except that it includes a <em>forward slash</em> before the
              element name. This states where the element ends — in this case
              where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of
              the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The content</strong>: This is the content of the element,
              which in this case, is just text.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The element</strong>: The opening tag, the closing tag,
              and the content together comprise the element.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
          <code>
            <span class="code-element">&lt;p</span>
            <span class="code-attr">class=</span
            ><span class="code-attr-value">"editor-note"</span
            ><span class="code-element">&gt;</span>My cat is very grumpy<span
              class="code-element"
              >&lt;/p&gt;</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            Attributes contain extra information about the element that you
            don't want to appear in the actual content. Here,
            <span class="box">class</span> is the attribute name and editor-note
            is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the
            element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and
            any other elements with the same class value) with style information
            and other things.
          </p>
          <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              A space between it and the element name (or the previous
              attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
            </li>
            <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
            <li>
              The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation
              marks.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Nesting_Elements">
          <h2>Nesting Elements</h2>
          <p>
            You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
            nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could
            wrap the word "very" in a
            <span class="box">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element, which means that
            the word is to be strongly emphasized:
          </p>
          <code>
            <span class="code-element">&lt;p&gt;</span>My cat is
            <span class="code-element">&lt;strong&gt;</span>very<span
              class="code-element"
              >&lt;/strong&gt;</span
            >
            grumpy.<span class="code-element">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
          </code>
          <p>
            You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly
            nested. In the example above, we opened the
            <span class="box">&lt;p&gt;</span> element first, then the
            <span class="box">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element; therefore, we have
            to close the <span class="box">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element first,
            then the <span class="box">&lt;p&gt;</span> element.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Empty_Elements">
          <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
          <p>
            Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take
            the <span class="box">&lt;img&gt;</span> element that we already
            have in our HTML page:
          </p>
          <code>
            <span class="code-element"
              >&lt;img <span class="code-attr">src=</span
              ><span class="code-attr-value">"images/test-image.png"</span>
              <span class="code-attr">alt=</span
              ><span class="code-attr-value">"My test image"</span>&gt;</span
            >
          </code>
          <p>
            This contains two attributes, but there is no closing
            <span class="box">&lt;/img&gt;</span> tag and no inner content. This
            is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its
            purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it
            appears.
          </p>

            That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they
            aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at how individual elements
            are combined to form an entire HTML page.
          </p>
          <p>Let's see this code:</p>
          <pre>
                <code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
<span class="code-element">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="code-element">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="code-element">&lt;meta <span class="code-attr">charset=<span class="code-attr-value">"utf-8"</span></span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="code-element">&lt;title&gt;</span>My test page<span class="code-element">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="code-element">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="code-element">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="code-element">&lt;img <span class="code-attr">src=</span><span class="code-attr-value">"images/test-image.png"</span><span class="code-attr">alt=</span><span class="code-attr-value">"My test image"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="code-element">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="code-element">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code>
</pre>
          <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="box">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span> — doctype. It is a
              required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young
              (around 1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of
              rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML,
              which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="box">&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</span>— the
              <span class="box">&lt;head&gt;</span> element. This element wraps
              all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the
              root element.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="box">&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>— the
              <span class="box">&lt;head&gt;</span> element. This element acts
              as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML
              page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's
              viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description
              that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our
              content, character set declarations, and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="box">&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</span>— This
              element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8
              which includes most characters from the vast majority of written
              languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="box">&lt;title&gt;&lt;title&gt;</span>— The
              <span class="box">&lt;title&gt;</span> element. This sets the
              title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser
              tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page
              when you bookmark/favorite it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="box">&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span> — the
              <span class="box">&lt;body&gt;</span> element. This contains all
              the content that you want to show to web users when they visit
              your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable
              audio tracks, or whatever else.
            </li>
